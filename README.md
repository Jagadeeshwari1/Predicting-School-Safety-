# Predicting-School-Safety-
# 📊 Predicting School Safety

This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the safety of schools in Chicago based on various socio-economic, environmental, and academic indicators. The model provides insights that can be used by policymakers, educators, and communities to improve school safety and foster better educational environments.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Predicting School Safety.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploration, model building, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory where datasets are stored (not included in this repo).
- `images/`: Visuals and plots generated during EDA and model evaluation.
- `models/`: Optional folder for saving trained models.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
